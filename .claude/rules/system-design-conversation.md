# The System-Design Conversation

Applies whenever a PRD, interview, hard-problems page, architecture or system design is being
written or discussed. The principles are `principles/system-design.md` (GP-107 – GP-119); in a
spin-off repo, `docs/principles/system-design.md`. The process they support is
`system-design-readiness/GUIDELINE.md`.

## Rules

1. **Walk the questions, don't wait to be asked.** Before a design is called ready, go through each
   principle's *Raise in the design conversation* list. A question the docs already answer gets a
   citation; an open one goes to Innocent **as options** (2–4, recommendation first), never as a
   blank question. **Who answers, when, and what may not be drafted first** is
   `system-design-questioning.md`: the foundation questions (load, peak, failure to survive, spend
   ceiling, hardest uncertainty) are asked before anything that depends on them, and a stand-in such
   as a test load is never an answer.
2. **Economics and scale bucket first [GP-107, GP-108].** No component is chosen before the cost per
   successful outcome and the scale bucket are written down.
3. **Depth where the partner is uncertain [GP-109].** Solved parts get one line each; the uncertain
   part becomes a hard-problem card.
4. **Trace one real operation before sizing anything [GP-112].** A server count, pool size or
   replica number with no traced operation behind it is an assumption, and is labelled as one.
5. **Label every number [GP-119]**: `[T]` target, `[A]` assumption, `[C]` calculation, `[M]`
   measurement. Every major choice ends with its *because → chose → verify → revisit when* sentence.
6. **Per-operation answers [GP-110, GP-114, GP-116].** Promises, overload behaviour and
   consistency-versus-availability are decided per operation, never once for the whole system.
